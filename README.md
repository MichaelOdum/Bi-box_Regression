# Bi-box_Regression

Pytorch implementation of Bi-box Regression as described in [Bi-box Regression for Pedestrian Detection and Occlusion Estimation (ECCV2018)](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jsyuan/papers/2018/Bi-box%20Regression%20for%20Pedestrian%20Detection.pdf).

The implementation is not just the same as the paper. We use one-stage detector RetinaNet followed by this [repo](https://github.com/yhenon/pytorch-retinanet). And some details may be different.

## Requirements

- Python3
- Pytorch0.4
- torchvision
- tensorboardX

## Installation

Install packages.

```
sudo apt-get install tk-dev python-tk

pip install cffi

pip install cython

pip install pandas

pip install tensorboardX
```

Build NMS.

```
cd Bi-box_Regression/lib
sh build.sh
```

Create folders.

```
cd Bi-box_Regression
mkdir ckpt mAP_txt summary weight
```

## Datasets
This repo is built for human detection. The popular annotation format for human detectionï¼ˆor pedestrian detection) contains three parts: full bbox, visible bbox and ignore regions such as [Citypersons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05693.pdf) and [Crowdhuman](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00123.pdf). You should write them in CSV or TXT files.

### Annotations format
Three examples are as follows:

```
$image_path/img_1.jpg x1 y1 x2 y2 x1v y1v x2v y2v person
$image_path/img_1.jpg x1 y1 x2 y2 ignore
$image_path/img_2.jpg . . . . .
```

x1 y1 x2 y2 mean full bbox and x1v y1v x2v y2v mean visible bbox.
Images with more than one bounding box should use one row per box. Labels that we often use are 'person' or 'ignore'. When an image does not contain any bounding box, set them '.'. 

### Label encoding file
A TXT file (classes.txt) is needed to map label to ID. Each line means one label name and its ID. One example is as follows:

```
person 0
```

## Pretrained Model

We use resnet18, 34, 50, 101, 152 as the backbone. You should download them and put them to '/weight'.
